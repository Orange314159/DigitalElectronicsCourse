I do not give permission for any of this work to be used or coppied by those that are currently taking this course (Digital Electronics at Liberal Arts and Science Academy). If you see this repository in search for help in your course feel free to reach out and email me with any questions you may have. If you are not taking this course currently I highly suggest you look around the different projects that I have completed here and find as much intrest in them as I have. I plan to add more explaination at a further date.
